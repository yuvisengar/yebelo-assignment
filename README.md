Assignment: Create a Note Taking App using Razor Pages, Entity Framework, Modals, Clean
Code, and Logic in .NET
Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to create a note taking app using Razor Pages, Entity
Framework, Modals, Clean Code, and Logic in .NET. The user should be able to view, add, edit,
and delete notes. Additionally, there should be a statistics page that shows how many times
notes have been added, edited, and deleted. The application should use the identity scaffold of
.NET to create a login and registration page, and all pages should be accessible only to logged-in
users.
Requirements:
1. The application should have a home page that displays a list of all notes that have been
added.
2. The user should be able to add a new note from the home page.
3. The user should be able to edit an existing note by clicking on it.
4. The user should be able to delete an existing note by clicking on it.
5. The application should have a statistics page that displays the total number of notes
added, edited, and deleted.
6. The application should use modals for adding, editing, and deleting notes.
7. The code should be well-organized, easy to read, and follow best practices for clean
code.
8. The application should use Entity Framework to manage the data and store it in a
database.
9. The application should use the identity scaffold of .NET to create a login and registration
page. No customizations needed, basic scaffold should be enough.
10. All pages should be accessible only to logged-in users.
Instructions:
1. Create a new .NET Razor Pages application.
2. Add Entity Framework to the project and create a database to store the notes.
3. Use the identity scaffold of .NET to create a login and registration page.
4. Create a home page that displays a list of all notes that have been added.
5. Add a button to the home page that opens a modal for adding a new note.
6. Add a button to each note that opens a modal for editing that note.
7. Add a button to each note that opens a modal for deleting that note.
8. Create a statistics page that displays the total number of notes added, edited, and
deleted.
9. Ensure that all pages can only be accessed by logged-in users.
10. Ensure that the code is well-organized, easy to read, and follows best practices for clean
code.
Submission:
1. Submit the code for the application by creating a github/gitlab repo. Ensure that you
commit incremental changes along the way, Weâ€™re interested in seeing your development
progress.
2. Submit a document explaining how the application works and how it meets the
requirements. No specific format, you are free to choose your own.
3. Submit a minimum 30 seconds video explaining your solution
